challenge you in a series\
of sophisticated wallkicks,\
with no break.\
You'll need to master\
your camera movement\
and input timing to\
complete this climb.\
The path forward might\
not be obvious at all point.\
Keep experimenting to\
find your way up!\
Practice with savestates\
before you go for a real\
run and you should\
succeed!\
Don't forget to take\
breaks as the intensity\
of the gameplay may\
stress your hands.\
You can use the pause\
menu to recover while in\
the middle of an attempt."))
