challenge you in a series\
of sophisticated slope,\
jumps with no break.\
\
You'll need to master\
your speed, camera\
movement and input\
timing to complete this\
climb.\
Practice with savestates\
before you go for a real\
run and you should\
succeed!\
\
Don't forget to take\
breaks as the intensity\
of the gameplay may\
stress your hands.\
\
You can use the pause\
menu to recover while in\
the middle of an attempt."))
